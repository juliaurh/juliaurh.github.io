Hi Hello!

My name is Julia Urh. I am a theatre performance major at Appalachian State University in Boone, NC. I love the entire world of theatre, on stage and off. In a regular day, you can find me in the scenic shop building sets, working on my latest dramaturgy assignment, or doing character research for my role. I also love to travel and experience new things, but I never spend too long away from my kitten, Ollie. The pictures below are from my trip to China and Ollie
